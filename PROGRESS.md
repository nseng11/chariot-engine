# Chariot Engine Progress Report

## Project Overview
Chariot Engine is a sophisticated trading simulation platform designed to facilitate multi-party watch trades. The platform employs graph theory and advanced matching algorithms to optimize trading opportunities among watch enthusiasts.

## Recent Updates (April 2025)

### Trade Matching Improvements
- **Value Efficiency Integration**
  - Implemented data-driven thresholds based on quartile analysis (Q1: 0.8338, Q2: 0.86, Q3: 0.898)
  - Added strong penalties for trades below 0.8 efficiency
  - Refined acceptance weights to prioritize efficient trades

- **Fairness Score Refinements**
  - Adjusted for right-skewed distribution (Q1: 0.7469, Q2: 0.7888, Q3: 0.8509)
  - Implemented granular fairness modifiers for better trade quality
  - Reduced impact of fairness relative to value efficiency

- **Trade Loop Finding**
  - Removed prioritization of 2-way trades
  - Enhanced 3-way trade discovery
  - Improved parallel trade consideration

### UI Enhancements
- **Streamlit Dashboard**
  - Added separate trade and user summary sections
  - Implemented percentage-based growth rate input
  - Enhanced visualization of trade type breakdown
  - Streamlined period summary display
